This is generally required for geo-targeting purposes (showing Indian ads to someone in India, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing house on rent ads to someone who frequents real estate websites). You can choose to disable or selectively turn off cookies or our third party cookies in your browser settings or by managing preferences in programmes such as Quick-Heal Internet Security. However this can affect how you are able to interact with our site and other websites. Thus could include inability to login to services or programs.<br><br>6.

We reserve the right to disallow, cancel, remove or reassign certain usernames and permalinks in appropriate circumstances, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and may, with or without prior notice, suspend or terminate your account if activities occur on that account which, in our sole discretion, would or might constitute a violation of these Terms of Use, or an infringement or violation of the rights of any third party, or of any applicable laws or regulations. You may terminate your account at any time as described in the Termination section below.<br><br><br>6.2 Your Content and Intellectual Property Rights You own all of the content and information you post on BWOW and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. Any and all text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information that you upload, store, transmit, submit, exchange or make available to or via the Platform (hereinafter &quot;Your Content&quot;) is generated, owned and controlled solely by you, and not by BWOW. BWOW does not claim any ownership rights in Your Content, and you hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that Your Content remains your sole responsibility. You must not upload, store, distribute, send, transmit, display, perform, make available, continue to make available or otherwise communicate to the public any Content to which you do not hold the necessary rights. In particular, any unauthorized use of copyright protected material within Your Content (including by way of reproduction, distribution, modification, adaptation, public display, public performance, preparation of derivative works, making available or otherwise communicating to the public via the Platform), independent of whether it is or becomes unauthorized at a later point, may constitute an infringement of third party rights and is strictly prohibited. Any such infringements may result in termination of your access to the Platform as described in the Repeat Infringers section below, and may also result in civil litigation or criminal prosecution by or on behalf of the relevant rights-holder. We may, from time to time, invite or provide you with means to provide feedback regarding the Platform, and in such circumstances, any feedback you provide will be deemed non-confidential and BWOW shall have the right, but not the obligation, to use such feedback on an unrestricted basis. When you delete IP content (photos, videos, blogs etc.), it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).When you publish content or information using „Everyone‟ setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of BWOW, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).<br><br>7. Grant of License By uploading or posting Your Content to the Platform, you initiate an automated process to direct BWOW to store Your Content on our servers, from where you may control and authorize the use, ways of reproduction, transmission, distribution, public display, public performance, making available (including whether users will be permitted to use your Content offline) and other communication to the public of Your Content on the Platform and elsewhere using the Services. To the extent it is necessary in order for BWOW to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution of advertising or other promotional material on our Platform and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licenses to BWOW on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis. By uploading Your Content to the Platform, you also grant a limited, worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up, license to other users of the Platform, and to operators and users of any other websites, apps and/or platforms to which Your Content has been shared or embedded using the Services (“Linked Services”), to use, copy, listen to offline, repost, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, adapt, prepare derivative works of, compile, make available and otherwise communicate to the public, Your Content utilizing the features of the Platform from time to time, and within the parameters set by you using the Services. You can limit and restrict the availability of certain of Your Content to other users of the Platform, and to users of Linked Services, at any time using the permissions tab in the track edit section for each sound you upload. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use grants any rights to any other user of the Platform with respect to any proprietary name, logo, trademark or service mark uploaded by you as part of Your Content (for example, your profile picture) (“Marks”), other than the right to reproduce, publicly display, make available and otherwise communicate to the public those Marks, automatically and without alteration, as part of the act of reposting sounds with which you have associated those Marks. The licenses granted in this section are granted separately with respect to each item of Your Content that you upload to the Platform. Licenses with respect to audio Content, and any images or text within your account, will (subject to the following paragraph of these Terms of Use) terminate automatically when you remove such Content from your account. Licenses with respect to comments or other contributions that you make on the Platform will be perpetual and irrevocable, and will continue notwithstanding any termination of your account. Removal of audio Content from your account will automatically result in the deletion of the relevant files from BWOW’’s systems and servers. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that once Your Content is distributed to a Linked Service, BWOW is not obligated to ensure the deletion of Your Content from any servers or systems operated by the operators of any Linked Service, or to require that any user of the Platform or any Linked Service deletes any item of Your Content. Furthermore, if you authorize any of Your Content to be available for offline, after deletion of an item of Your Content or removal from the ability for other users to listen to the applicable Content offline, the applicable Content may still be temporarily available to other users of the Platform who saved the applicable Content for offline use on their devices, but no longer than 30 days from the time of deletion. Any Content other than Your Content is the property of the relevant user who uploads it, and is or may be subject to copyright, trademark rights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such Content may not be downloaded, reproduced, distributed, transmitted, re-uploaded, republished, displayed, sold, licensed, made available or otherwise communicated to the public or exploited for any purposes except via the features of the Platform from time to time and within the parameters set by the user who has uploaded it on the Platform or with the express written consent of such user. Where you repost another user‟s Content, or include another user‟s Content in a playlist or album or where you listen to another user‟s Content offline, you acquire no ownership rights whatsoever in that Content. Subject to the rights expressly granted in this section, all rights in Content are reserved to the relevant user who uploads it.<br><br>8.

Blocking and Removal of Content Notwithstanding the fact that BWOW has no legal obligation to monitor the content on the Platform, BWOW reserves the right to block, remove or delete any content at any time, and to limit or restrict access to any content, for any reason and without liability, including without limitation, if we have reason to believe that such content does or might infringe the rights of any third party, has been uploaded or posted in breach of these Terms of Use, or applicable law, or is otherwise unacceptable to BWOW.<br><br>11. Repeated Infringement BWOW will suspend or terminate your access to the Platform if BWOW determines, in its reasonable discretion, that you have repeatedly breached these Terms of Use. If we receive a valid notification from a third party in accordance with our reporting processes or applicable law that any of Your Content infringes the copyright or other rights of such third party, or if we believe that your behaviour violates our terms we will send you a written warning to this effect. Any user that receives more than two of these warnings is liable to have their access to the Platform terminated forthwith. We will also suspend or terminate your account without warning if ordered to do so by a court, and/or in other appropriate circumstances, as determined by BWOW at its discretion.
