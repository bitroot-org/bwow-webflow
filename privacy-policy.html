No one under age 18 may provide any personal information to us or on the Products. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at support@bwow.fit.<br><br></p>
        <p class="paragraph-5"><strong class="bold-text">What information does BWOW collect?<br>‍<br></strong>We gather various types of personal information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this personal information to personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Mobile App and Product, and as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. We may share certain types of personal information with third parties. We collect the following types of information:<br>‍<br><span class="text-span-3"><strong>Information you provide to us:</strong></span><strong><br>‍</strong>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect personal information such as your name, username, email address, gender, birth date, weight, height, location, nutrition data, workouts, physical activity, photographs, biometric information, and sleep habits and we may collect other sleep, activity, or health-related information as our services and products are further developed. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features / Products. We may anonymize your personal information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. For example, you may tell us that you are female and sleep an average of 6 hours per night; we may combine this information with content received from our other users, and disclose to our partners that on the whole, our male users sleep more hours per night than our female ones, but we will not tell those partners who you are.<br> <br><span class="text-span-4">‍<strong>Information collected automatically: <br></strong></span><strong>‍</strong>Whenever you interact with our Mobile App, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, &#x27;cookie&#x27; information, and the page you requested. &#x27;Cookies&#x27; are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our Mobile App are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device&#x27;s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of our Mobile App&#x27;s best features.When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Mobile App), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Mobile App, so that we can make the Mobile App appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often people use our Mobile App, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. If you are using our Products, you understand and acknowledge that, any information, data or readings from the Product, or collected from your use thereof, will be automatically uploaded to your account with us. To the extent these automatically collected readings can be used to personally identify you, these readings are personal information for the purposes of this privacy policy.<strong> <br>‍<br></strong><span class="text-span-5"><strong>Delete targeting cookies:<br></strong></span><strong>‍</strong>Your interest profile can be removed by deleting your browser&#x27;s cookies.Information stored on cookies The cookie information stored on the User&#x27;s hard drive is: (i) User segment hits or information on a specific product, service, brand or model in which the User has shown interest during its visit to a certain website and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User profile.If the cookie is deleted by the User, all profile data is removed. For the sake of clarity, no segments relating to information which BWOW considers sensitive have been or will be created, such as segments relating to political opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or sexual life. Further, BWOW is very sensitive to the issue of children&#x27;s privacy and marketing directed to children. No segments are intended to be established for the profiling of children.<strong> <br>‍<br></strong><span class="text-span-6"><strong>E-mail and other communications:</strong> <br></span>We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of the Mobile App or the Product.
